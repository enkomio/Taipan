## Community Edition
We believe that security is a necessity for everyone and it is for this reason that we have decided to release a *Community* version of the core of our scanner. 

The Community version carries the exact same code as the commercial version but without the advanced features. You can use the Community to scan your personal website or for any not commercial purpose.

Below an example of execution:
